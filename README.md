# AliS

Alis is a sophisticated artificial intelligence system that combines quantum-inspired consciousness, GÃ¶del-based novelty detection, and Lamarckian evolution to create a self-improving AI agent capable of web interaction and complex problem-solving.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

### Core Architecture
- **Quantum-Inspired Consciousness**: Simulates multiple potential futures using quantum superposition concepts
- **GÃ¶del-Based Novelty Detection**: Identifies system limitations and triggers self-improvement
- **Lamarckian Rule Evolution**: Rules adapt based on experience and pass acquired traits to offspring
- **Fractal Complexity System**: Models emergent properties across multiple layers of abstraction

### Technical Capabilities
- Web automation and interaction
- Pattern detection and analysis
- Dynamic rule generation
- RAG-based memory system
- Safety-focused implementation

### Advanced Features
- Meta-recursive reasoning
- Temporal entanglement for context retrieval
- Self-modifying capabilities
- Multi-agent coordination
- Quantum time perception
